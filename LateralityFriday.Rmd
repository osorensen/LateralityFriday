# Background

- How to determine which hemisphere is dominant for a given task, based on indirect measurements?

- Example 

  - Measurement: Right/left ear advantage in dichotic listening
  
  - Inference: Left/right dominance for language processing
  
--

- Problem: Most people are left dominant.

- Satz (1977) showed, based on then available data from sodium-amytal tests:

  - Seeing that a person has a left-ear advantage increases the probability that the person is right dominant from 0.05 to 0.10.
  
  - Seeing a right-ear advantage increases the probability of left dominance from 0.95 to 0.97.

# Background

- Question: Do Satz' conclusions still hold, our can we do something better?

- Some opportunities:

  - Dichotic listening experiments given a continuous index, e.g. between -100 and 100, rather than simply left/right.

  - Can repeated measurements of the same subject give more reliable conclusions?

  - New data are available, so the probabilities of left and right dominance in the population should be updated.
  
  - Handedness is an additional source of information.

# A model for inferring hemispheric dominance

---

# Component 1: Prior probability

- Let $p(\alpha)$ denote the probability that a given person in the population has hemispheric dominance $\alpha$.

- In Carey and Johnstone (2014), we find, for right-handers:

  - Probability of left dominance for language processing is $p(\alpha = \text{left}) = 0.87$
  
  - Accordingly, $p(\alpha = \text{non-left}) = 0.13$
  
- Our goal is to infer the value of $\alpha$ based on something which is more easy to measure.

# Component 2: Conditional probability

.pull-left[
- Let $p(x|\alpha)$ denote the conditional probability of observing a dichotic listening score $x$ for a person with hemispheric dominance $\alpha$.

- In van der Haegen et al. (2013) we find:

  - With left dominance, mean of $x$ is 12, with standard deviation 17.
  
  - With right dominance, mean of $x$ is -24.

- Classical test theory: Assume measurements $x$ are normally distributed around the mean for each group.

# Component 3: Posterior probability

- Bayes' theorem gives us a way to compute the probability of hemispheric dominance $\alpha$ given a prior distribution $p(\alpha)$ and a condition probability $p(x|\alpha)$.

$$p(\alpha | x) = \frac{p(x | \alpha) p(\alpha)}{p(x | \alpha = \text{left}) p(\alpha = \text{left}) + p(x | \alpha = \text{non-left}) p(\alpha = \text{non-left})}$$

- To summarize:

  - $p(\alpha)$ is the proportion of left and non-left dominant individuals in the population.
  
  - $p(x|\alpha)$ is the probability of observing a measurement $x$ for an individual with dominance $\alpha$.
  
  - $p(\alpha |x )$ is the probability of dominance $\alpha$ for an individual with observation $x$.

# Some examples


---

# Probability of left or non-left dominance

- A single measurement $x$ between -100 and 100, where negative numbers imply left-ear advantage and positive numbers imply right-ear advantage. Right-handers only.

  - Already at a measure of -10, the probability of left dominance exceeds 80%.
  
  - Probability of right dominance exceeds 80% at -33 or below.

---

# How certain are we?

- 2,855 dichotic listening measurements of right-handers, obtained with the iDichotic App. 

- Rule: If probability of left/right is at least 80%, then classify. Otherwise leave unclassified.

  - 2517 classified as left dominant, 105 as right dominant, and 233 unclassified.

# Multiple measurements

# Multiple measurements

- We expect two measurements of the same individual to be more correlated than two measurements of different individuals.

- Define 

  - $\sigma_{b}^{2}$, variance between individuals
  
  - $\sigma_{w}^{2}$, variance within individuals
  

- This intraclass correlation can be estimated from the data at hand

$$r = \frac{\sigma_{b}^{2}}{\sigma_{w}^{2} + \sigma_{b}^{2}}$$

  
- With an extension of the formula for posterior probability of hemispheric dominance, we can use this information.

# Multiple measurements

- First measurement shown along the horizontal axis.

- Second measurement indicated by color code.

- Dashed line shows the reference probability for a single measurement.

- Essentially, two measurements pointing in the same direction makes us more certain.

# Multiple measurements

- Data from Karlsson et al. (2019): 871 participants, each with three perceptual laterality measures.

- The table shows the effect of using only the first measurement ($n=1$), the first and second ($n=2$), and all ($n=3$).

# Simulation experiments

- We simulated data with a known truth, and investigated how well we were able to classify the individuals.

---
# Classification threshold

- We have used an 80% threshold for classification, meaning that if the probability of left hemispheric dominance is between 20% and 80%, we say "Undecided". 

- Note that this threshold applies to the last classified individual. The average probability among the classified is typically around 95%.

- The choice of 80% is essentially arbitrary, and depends on the trade-off between:

  - How bad is it to make a mistake?
  
  - How bad is it to leave someone unclassified?
  
- Some additional simulation results illustrate this.

# Some comments

# Parameters

- The model depends on independent data estimating:

  1. The prevalence of a given hemispheric dominance $\alpha$ in the population: $p(\alpha)$.
  
  2. The mean and standard deviation of measurement $x$ for people in each group defined by $\alpha$: $p(x|\alpha)$.
  
- Given this, the machinery works, and produces the probability of hemispheric dominance given data: $p(\alpha|x)$.

- Extensions to multiple classes, e.g., left dominant, bilateral, right dominant, is in principle straightforward, but requires parameter estimates. We show this in Appendix 2.

- Using multiple measurement paradigms is also possible, and we show this in Appendix 3. Again, the problem is points 1 and 2 above.
